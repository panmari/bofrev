# The abstract methods that need to be overwritten are
# (for their respective functionality, see below):
#
#   self.theme_list
#   self.sound_effect_list

#   self.game_map

  #   at a time step (determined by a Ticker thread).

  # Return a Hash containing meta information about how model data

  # a Canvas' resolution, its number of pixels, how many times it
  # is supposed to be redrawn (i.e. how many times it should be
  # updated/redrawn per second).
  #
  # @example: Extracted from TetrisMetaData

  #   :width_pixels [Integer] number of pixels in width.
  #     How many pixels are there per row.
  #   :height_pixels [Integer] number of pixels in height.
  #     How many pixels are there per column.
  #   :max_width [Integer] canvas window pixel width,
  #     window will be scaled to this width.
  #     Idally, max_width is equal to cell_size*width_pixels
  #     to fit into the canvas optimal in width.
  #   :max_height [Integer] canvas window pixel height,
  #     window will be scaled to this height.
  #     Idally, max_height is equal to cell_size*height_pixels
  #     to fit into the canvas optimal in height.
  #   :tics_per_second [Integer] how many redraws/updates should be performed per second.
  #     When its value is set to something <= 0, then the Ticker thread will not run.

  # Returns a Hash of controls that are supported by a target game.
  # Acts as the whitelist of Controls a View will listen to.
  # The behavior of how an application should handle certain control events
  #  - which it listens to - is defined in the appropriate Map
  # descendent class of the target application. Thus, despite having
  # defined some behavior in a Map, the application
  # will only react to whitelisted controls.
  #
  # @info: keys that occur in this list of controls are listening to
  # keystroke or mouse movement events. Therefore, even a key is defined in
  # a Map, but it is not included in this list,
  # it will not handle the defined Map behavior,
  # when the corresponding key event occurs.
  #
  # @example: Taken from GameOfLifeMetaData
  #

  #       :keyboard => [A_KEY, S_KEY, W_KEY],
  #       :mouse => [LEFT_MOUSE_BUTTON_PRESSED, LEFT_MOUSE_BUTTON_DRAGGED]

  #
  # @hint: The Hash of allowed controls has two known keys,
  #   :keyboard, that references an Array,
  #     containing all whitelisted keyboard controls and
  #   :mouse, an Array containing all whitelisted mouse events the app should listen to.
  #     Again, please note that only controlls included in this white-list
  #     can have a behavior that is actually run.
  #   Please have a look into the module ControlConstants to see what control constants are
