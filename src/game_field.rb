# A GameField is an element of a Grid data structure.
# Each GameField is associated with an index (colum, row) in a parent Grid.
# Every GameField is in a certain state stored in the attribute :type.
# This states defines whether or not a field is fixed on its parent grid or freely movable.
#   see the module GameFieldTypeConstants for further information.
# Lastely, each gamefield has a color assigned. By default it is the color white.
# A gamefield can query its neighbor grid fields (either its  4-or 8-one-neighborhood).
# Each gamefield is therefore an Enumerable over its neighborhood.
