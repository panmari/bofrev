# SystemInformation provides runtime information such as on which os bofrev is running
# or by whom it is called (either from the console or by an exectuable jar).
# This kind of system information will be used to handle os/system specific circumstances
# that affect the runtime behaviour of bofrev. For example, on windows there is a different
# offset for the canvas required (since unit pixels seem be differently sized than on other os).
# Another example is the case when bofrev is called by its exectuable jar.
# Then the whole pathing has to be differently handled (otherwise music/image files
# will not be loaded correctly). This is due to the fact that
# the jar has a different file hierarchy.
