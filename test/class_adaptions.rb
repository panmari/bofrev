# ClassAdaptions is a set of class adaptions used during
# the testing process. Some methods of some classes need
# an adaption of their behavior in order to make them testable.
#
# @hint: when testing View, Canvas classes, we don't want
#   to span a gui. Especially travis hates such a behavior.
#   Furthermore, threading has to be simulated.
# @info: This reduced unknown side effects. applying :class_eval
#   in different tests on the same target class results
#   in having unknown side effects.
# @example: Assume bofrev defines a class Socks that has a method
#   :wash defining an appropriate behaviour
#   (unuseful for testing). Then, in order to test this method
#   modify this class' method such that it is testable. In
#   the following an example how such a modification is supposed
#   to look like:
#
#     Socks.class_eval do
#       def wash
#         # do something meaningful and testable
#         # mocking the previous washing behavior.
#       end
#
