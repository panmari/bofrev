# DummyClasses is a set of classes defined only within the testing environment
# used for testing. E.g used for testing whether extending/including modules
# in a class worked as expected. Having all these dummy classes at one common
# place reduces code duplication and the risk of potential side effects when
# defining in two different test classes a dumming class having the same name,
# with a method having the same name but a different implementation.
#
# @example: How a new dummy class is supposed to look like:
#
#   # @info is used by
#   # MENTION HERE IN WHICH TEST CLASS THIS DUMMY IS USED
#   class ANewDummy
#
module DummyClasses
